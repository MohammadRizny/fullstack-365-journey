# Fullstack 365 Journey

This repository is my *learning journey* into full‑stack development — starting with frontend fundamentals (HTML & CSS) and building real projects every day as part of my 365‑day learning challenge.

## 📌 What this project is
This folder contains:
- Basic HTML and CSS files I built as part of my learning exercises
- Early frontend examples showing structure and layout

This project **does not yet include backend code** — it’s a frontend foundation for my full‑stack learning path.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- ✅ HTML
- ✅ CSS

## 🔍 What I learned
During this project, I practiced:
- HTML page structure
- Semantic tags (header, footer, sections)
- Basic layout using default CSS
- Organizing files and folders in a beginner full‑stack repo

## 👨‍💻 Next steps
- Add CSS styling and responsive layout
- Create more structured pages
- Add JavaScript for interactivity
- Eventually add backend (Node.js, Express, database)

## 🔗 Live Demo (optional)
I plan to deploy this using GitHub Pages soon. Stay tuned!

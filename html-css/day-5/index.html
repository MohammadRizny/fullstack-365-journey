      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It
        defines the layout of a webpage by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables,
        and forms. HTML works as the backbone of every website, allowing browsers to understand and display content
        correctly. It is easy to learn, beginner-friendly, and essential for anyone starting web development, as it
        provides the foundation needed to add styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript.

          <p><strong>Caribbean</strong></p>

          <p>The Caribbean is famous for its
            stunning beaches, crystal-clear
            turquoise waters, and warm tropical
            climate
            that attracts visitors from around
            the world. Soft white sand shores,
            swaying palm trees, and vibrant cora
            reefs create a perfect setting for
            relaxation and adventure. Caribbean
            beaches are ideal for swimming,
            snorkeling, sunbathing, and enjoying
            breathtaking sunsets, while the
            laid-back island culture adds to the
            charm. With its natural beauty and
            peaceful atmosphere, the Caribbean
            offers an unforgettable beach
            experience.
